Digital Twins have been bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world for a while now. Industry leaders have gladly taken the challenges of integrating legacy machinery with computers to forge new cyber-physical systems.

This synergy is capable not only of providing enhanced monitoring but also of assuring improved incident reaction times. The factory-wide control that these connected systems provide allows for higher production efficiency and accurate sub-day reporting of activities and incidents. Factories also get a combined improvement in both quality and workers' safety: by moving workers from the factory floor and towards computer control and monitoring, they're effectively safely away from hazards, and additionally, these same systems will allow them to work more precisely and with better information, therefore, improving output quality.

So what is an AI Twin? Until now many cyber-digital systems would still take a toll on workers due to requiring deep knowledge of the systems being worked, constant attention to warnings, and plenty of manual input to achieve optimized control. This not only makes it harder to retrain workers for these tasks, but also increases the pressure on a scarce pool of highly skilled workers that instead of supervision, training, and expert tasks are many times required to run daily activities. Given recent developments in AI that provide highly optimized tools to process and query knowledge, it is effectively within the grasp of every factory to get synthetic expert systems to help their workers run their daily activities, freeing up their more expert resources for the tasks that actually require them. At Hyper we are working with partners to come up with solutions that fit industry needs for automation, monitoring, maintenance, and knowledge.

The Knowledge Base
{: .mt-16 .text-3xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

The first and more important component of an expert system is the knowledge that it has access to. From domain ontologies to repair manuals all of this information is required and used to tune operations in order to reduce downtime and waste and improve reliability, safety, and efficiency.
{: .mt-6 }

A greater challenge has been that plenty of operational information is actually unstructured data - manuals, logs, reports - that needed to be parsed manually in order to be inserted into the systems. With large language models - such as ChatGPT - we get systems that can summarize and extract information from all of these sources with minimal human input besides quality monitoring. This allows the rapid integration of any sources available, and provides the ability to query the system in a natural way, so that even workers that are not experts can help troubleshoot problems, create reports, and interpret monitoring signals.
{: .mt-6 }

A digital source of truth for operational processes and tasks is not only a convenience but also a necessity for uninterrupted efficient operations and is already present in many enterprises. An AI Twin aims not to replace existing best practices but to complement them and extend them where needed to provide seamless improvements throughout the production efforts.
{: .mt-6 }

Let's look at a specific example in waste processing. These kinds of operations range from requiring high manual labour during sorting to using automated sorters capable of quickly processing and separating materials. Assuming the latter state of affairs, one might think that the required control and monitoring system already checks most of the digital needs of the enterprise. Engineering marvels as these machines might be, they are also fit for purpose in order to be as economical, reliable, and performant as possible. This means that they will not incorporate most capabilities extraneous to their purpose, those being left to other systems that will complement them to fulfil what organizational needs are left. In this way, an AI Twin will join existing informational systems to capture and process information, and extend them with the ability to perform tasks such as automated reporting, automated monitoring, computer-aided maintenance and troubleshooting, among others.

Capabilities
{: .mt-16 .text-3xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

Conversational Assistants
{: .mt-10 .text-xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

Conversational Assistants provide the framework for human-machine interaction in AI Twins. They allow the worker to engage with the computer without any specialized tool besides bare written communication skills. They also provide the ability to skim through thousands of pages of information via a simple query, which together with data source tracking allows the worker to confidently perform their tasks. This allows us to bypass many of the current problems with the fallibility of AI technology by embedding the information about the sources where the answer came from.

Looking at an example from container terminal logistics. These operations are often highly automatized in ports that are on the technological forefront, but even in those, there's always a human element given the large number of truck drivers that need to interact with these systems daily. Congestion and customs clearing is often a problem, many times exacerbated by linguistic barriers and by the constant context switching on the part of the human operators. Providing a first line of communication that is automated and yet able to accurately explain what procedures are required is a way to ameliorate the chaos that sometimes plagues these operations at certain times. Using conversational assistants here will provide multi-language capabilities to the operators, this will speed up the response to drivers' problems, and also give terminal operators the focus needed to solve issues that actually require a human touch.

Monitoring and Alerts
{: .mt-10 .text-xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

One of the most common tasks in a factory is operational monitoring. This is done to identify ongoing issues, inform changes required by different production schedules, and keep operations within regulatory constraints. Our systems can be used alone or in combination with other monitoring systems and provide enhanced information monitoring: this means that the system can draw on its knowledge base to provide additional context to workers.

Predictions and Forecasts
{: .mt-10 .text-xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

In order to tune production to keep within satisfactory KPI levels every system needs the ability to use the past to make informed predictions about the future state of things. This can range from simple production forecasts, to actually complex parametric simulations to find the best way to improve production. We aim to incorporate traditional methods and enhanced knowledge methodologies in our systems to provide a diverse set of tools that fit the different tasks.

Insights and Analytics
{: .mt-10 .text-xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

No industry is however purely operations, there are informational requirements for a long-term strategy that require reports on detailed operational information. On this front, we combine traditional business intelligence tools with our enhanced knowledge systems to provide the charts and tables required for reports and enhanced analyses. We can automatically write reports that will use the system's knowledge to interpret and extract insights that may not be immediately obvious from the data, this allows the analysts to be complemented in their work and focus on providing their expert inputs to management instead of using their precious time on information processing.

What about [enter problem description]?
{: .mt-16 .text-3xl .font-bold .tracking-tight .text-gray-900 }

An AI Twins needs not to be a one size fits all solution, in reality, such implementation will be plagued with excessive generalizations that will often be a burden to operations. Much in the same way databases and ERP systems are often made to be tailored to specific sets of processes, an AI Twin should be built from a modular perspective and specifically tailored to the actual needs and problems it ought to solve. In such a manner a waste processing plant will probably not need the AI systems capabilities for simulation that a large-scale construction engineering operation might need for accurate predictions for sediment movements and weather pattern changes.  
{: .mt-6 }

However impressive some of the latest developments are, one ought to be cautious so as to not suffer from over-optimistic and simplistic assumptions, as sometimes spread through outrageous marketing claims. We are far from the ability to replace humans in their activities, what we can do with automation and AI is create more efficient operations that also provide improved worker safety and satisfaction, and leave repetition and hazards to machines that are more than capable of handling them. The AI Twin is here not to take over but to be a partner to humans everywhere, complementing them whenever needed without becoming an additional burden on their work.
