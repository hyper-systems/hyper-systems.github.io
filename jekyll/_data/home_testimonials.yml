    of just a few weeks. allowed us to completely consolidate our data platform into one for the first time... Their support and

    Hyper's platform is a simple but powerful way for us to collect data from our farm.
    By outsourcing the farm-to-cloud pipeline, we've been able to focus on the challenges
    that matter to us; making use of that data in our data warehouse to actually growing our crops.
