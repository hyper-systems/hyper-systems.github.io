                <p class="text-xl leading-8">Digital Twins have been bridging the gap between the physical and the
                    digital world for a while now. Industry leaders have gladly taken the challenges of integrating
                    legacy machinery with computers to forge new cyber-physical systems.
                </p>

                <div class="mt-10">
                    </p>This synergy is capable not only of providing enhanced monitoring but also of assuring improved
                    incident reaction times. The factory-wide control that these connected systems provide allows for
                    higher production efficiency and accurate sub-day reporting of activities and incidents. Factories
                    also get a combined improvement in both quality and workers' safety: by moving workers from the
                    factory floor and towards computer control and monitoring, they're effectively safely away from
                    hazards, and additionally, these same systems will allow them to work more precisely and with better
                    information, therefore, improving output quality.</p>
                    <p class="mt-8">So what is an AI Twin? Until now many cyber-digital systems would still take a toll
                        on workers due to requiring deep knowledge of the systems being worked, constant attention to
                        warnings, and plenty of manual input to achieve optimized control. This not only makes it harder
                        to retrain workers for these tasks, but also increases the pressure on a scarce pool of highly
                        skilled workers that instead of supervision, training, and expert tasks are many times required
                        to run daily activities. Given recent developments in AI that provide highly optimized tools to
                        process and query knowledge, it is effectively within the grasp of every factory to get
                        synthetic expert systems to help their workers run their daily activities, freeing up their more
                        expert resources for the tasks that actually require them. At Hyper we are working with partners
                        to come up with solutions that fit industry needs for automation, monitoring, maintenance, and
                        knowledge.</p>

                    <p class="mt-6">The first and more important component of an expert system is the knowledge that it
                        has access to. From domain ontologies to repair manuals all of this information is required and
                        used to tune operations in order to reduce downtime and waste and improve reliability, safety,
                        and efficiency.</p>
                    <p class="mt-10">A greater challenge has been that plenty of operational information is actually
                        unstructured data - manuals, logs, reports - that needed to be parsed manually in order to be
                        inserted into the systems. With large language models - such as ChatGPT - we get systems that
                        can summarize and extract information from all of these sources with minimal human input besides
                        quality monitoring. This allows the rapid integration of any sources available, and provides the
                        ability to query the system in a natural way, so that even workers that are not experts can help
                        troubleshoot problems, create reports, and interpret monitoring signals.</p>
                    <p class="mt-10">A digital source of truth for operational processes and tasks is not only a
                        convenience but also a necessity for uninterrupted efficient operations and is already present
                        in many enterprises. An AI Twin aims not to replace existing best practices but to complement
                        them and extend them where needed to provide seamless improvements throughout the production
                        efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-10">Let's look at a specific example in waste processing. These kinds of operations
                        range from requiring high manual labour during sorting to using automated sorters capable of
                        quickly processing and separate materials. Assuming the latter state of affairs, one might think
                        that the required control and monitoring already checks most of the digital needs of the
                        enterprise. </p>

                        of the enterprise. Engineering marvels as these machines might be, they are also fit for purpose
                        in order to be as economical, reliable, and performant as possible. This means that they will
                        not incorporate most capabilities extraneous to their purpose, those being left to other systems
                        that will complement them to fulfil what organizational needs are left. In this way, an AI Twin
                        will join existing informational systems to capture and process information, and extend them
                        with the ability to perform tasks such as automated reporting, automated monitoring,
                        computer-aided maintenance and troubleshooting, among others.</p>

                        pages of information via a simple query, which together with data source tracking allows the
                        worker to confidently perform their tasks. This allows us to bypass many of the current problems

                        always a human element given the large number of truck drivers that need to interact with these
                        systems daily. Congestion and customs clearing is often a problem, many times exacerbated by
                        linguistic barriers and by the constant context switching on the part of the human operators.
                        Providing a first line of communication that is automated and yet able to accurately explain
                        what procedures are required is a way to ameliorate the chaos that sometimes plagues these
                        operations at certain times. Using conversational assistants here will provide multi-language
                        capabilities to the operators, this will speed up the response to drivers' problems, and also
                        give terminal operators the focus needed to solve issues that actually require a human touch.

                    <p class="mt-6">One of the most common tasks in a factory is operational monitoring. This is done to
                        identify ongoing issues, inform changes required by different production schedules, and keep
                        operations within regulatory constraints. Our systems can be used alone or in combination with
                        other monitoring systems and provide enhanced information monitoring: this means that the system
                        can draw on its knowledge base to provide additional context to workers.

                    <h3 class="mt-10 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900">Predictions and Forecasts</h3>
                    <p class="mt-6">In order to tune production to keep within satisfactory KPI levels every system
                        needs the ability to use the past to make informed predictions about the future state of things.
                        This can range from simple production forecasts, to actually complex parametric simulations to
                        find the best way to improve production. We aim to incorporate traditional methods and enhanced
                        knowledge methodologies in our systems to provide a diverse set of tools that fit the different
                        tasks.

                    <h3 class="mt-10 text-xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900"> Insights and Analytics</h3>
                    <p class="mt-6">No industry is however purely operations, there are informational requirements for a
                        long-term strategy that require reports on detailed operational information. On this front, we
                        combine traditional business intelligence tools with our enhanced knowledge systems to provide
                        the charts and tables required for reports and enhanced analyses. We can automatically write
                        reports that will use the system's knowledge to interpret and extract insights that may not be
                        immediately obvious from the data, this allows the analysts to be complemented in their work and
                        focus on providing their expert inputs to management instead of using their precious time on
                        information processing.

                    </h2>
                    <p class="mt-6">An AI Twins needs not to be a one size fits all solution, in reality, such
                        implementation will be plagued with excessive generalizations that will often be a burden to
                        operations. Much in the same way databases and ERP systems are often made to be tailored to
                        specific sets of processes, an AI Twin should be built from a modular perspective and
                        specifically tailored to the actual needs and problems it ought to solve. In such a manner a
                        waste processing plant will probably not need the AI systems capabilities for simulation that a
                        large-scale construction engineering operation might need for accurate predictions for sediment
                        movements and weather pattern changes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-6">However impressive some of the latest developments are, one ought to be cautious so
                        as to not suffer from over-optimistic and simplistic assumptions, as sometimes spread through
                        outrageous marketing claims. We are far from the ability to replace humans in their activities,
                        what we can do with automation and AI is create more efficient operations that also provide
                        improved worker safety and satisfaction, and leave repetition and hazards to machines that are
                        more than capable of handling them. The AI Twin is here not to take over but to be a partner to
                        humans everywhere, complementing them whenever needed without becoming an additional burden on
                        their work.
